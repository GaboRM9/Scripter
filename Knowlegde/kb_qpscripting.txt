Description:
What is Custom Scripting?
The custom scripting is used to change the flow of surveys or take actions based on customized, user-defined triggers. These triggers are based on the responses to the questions.
QuestionPro offers a custom logic engine to apply code scripts in the Apache Velocity language on branching and looping. Velocity is a Java-based template engine that provides a template language to reference Java objects. You can configure this question to apply code scripts on branching and debugging with the below settings.
Logic includes branching : If you want to jump to a question based on specific conditions, enable this option. The survey will skip rest of the questions and jump to the destination as configured in the script code.
Note:
This option will need at least one branchTo() function to be present in the script otherwise it will redirect the user to the thank you page.
Logic includes looping : If you want the survey to loop through one or more questions, enable this option. It will display a set of questions repeatedly. The system saves multiple rows of data for each loop executed.
Debugging: This option is used for debugging the execution of the script code. You can check the output after each command is executed.
Auto-Submit: To auto-submit the page after script execution, enable this option. The survey will move to the next page without clicking on the 'Next' button.
What is the use of the custom logic question?
The custom logic engine question type can b used to fulfill a variety of custom requirements like
Course evaluation survey: The survey creator can ask the same set of questions for different courses. For each course, the survey can loop through the questionnaire.
Restaurant evaluation survey: Restaurant chains often conduct an online survey to collect customer feedback. If they have visited multiple food joints, the study would ask questions that compare the performance of the various outlets. You can use the custom logic question to set the custom variable with the restaurant name or location and ask questions specific to it.

Example 1
Here we check which option is selected for Q1 and depending on that we update the value of variable Custom1 with the correct text. If option 5 that is the Other option is selected then the variable Custom1 will get updated with the user input text. To refer to the text entered for the Other option we use: "QuestionCode_OTHER". Hence in the example script, QuestionCode is Q1 to refer the user input in the other option for question Q1.
We are also branching to the next question which is Q2 for each selection. If required we can branch to different questions based on the selection. You can use ${custom1} to display the value stored in the variable Custom1 on the survey. Once updated the Custom1 value can be used anywhere on the survey.
arrow_right
Script
#if (${Q1} == 1)
            $survey.updateCustom1("Baseball")
            $survey.branchTo("Q2")
        #end
            
        #if (${Q1} == 2)
            $survey.updateCustom1("Rugby")
            $survey.branchTo("Q2")
        #end
            
        #if (${Q1} == 3)
            $survey.updateCustom1("Soccer")
            $survey.branchTo("Q2")
        #end
            
        #if (${Q1} == 4)
            $survey.updateCustom1("Basketball")
            $survey.branchTo("Q2")
        #end
            
        #if (${Q1} == 5)
            $survey.updateCustom1("${Q1_OTHER}")
            $survey.branchTo("Q2")
        #end
Example 2
To redirect the user to a question based on their answer to the current question you can use the script below:
arrow_right
Script
##single select questions
        #if(${Q2} == 1)
            $survey.branchTo("Q10")
        #end
            
        #if(${Q2} == 2)
            $survey.branchTo("Q11")
        #end
                
        ##Multi select questions branching
        #if (${Q1_1} == "1" )
            $survey.branchTo("Q10")
        #end
                    
        #if (${Q1_2} == "1" )
            $survey.branchTo("Q11")
        #end
Here, Q2 is the current question and Q10, Q11 are the questions after Q2.

Why QuestionPro uses JavaScript?
QuestionPro uses JavaScript for custom scripting because JavaScript is,
supported on all the browsers.
used by the browsers to create dynamic & interactive user experience.
syntactically easy and flexible
What are the options to add JavaScript to Questionpro surveys?
QuestionPro provides two options to add JavaScript to your survey:
JavaScript Logic:
This option is used to add custom JavaScript on question level to acheive the desired survey flow. The JavaScript logic is further sub-divided into two sub-options:
Pre JavaScript logic: This option is used to execute the JavaScript before the question is displayed to the respondents.
Post JavaScript logic: This option is used to execute the JavaScript after the next button is clicked.
Custom JS:
This option is used to add custom JavaScript on survey level.
FAQs
What do I need to know to start using JavaScript?
HTML forms the basis of any JavaScript and hence good to average knowledge about HTML basics is essential.In addition to that, understanding of basic JavaScript - the syntax, the basic statements, the conditional statements and the data types, is required.
When should I consider using JavaScript validation on the question?
There are multiple scenarios where JavaScript validation could be extremely handy and useful to solve your complex validation problems.
For instance :
You want to validate complex questions like flex matrix, conjoint, heatmap etc, where system validations would be limited.
Where you would want to validate the question based on response to prior questions in the survey.
Do client side validation so the request is not submitted to the server.
Very specific/ custom validation on any question type. For instance you want only people who select 1 option from first 5 choices and 1 option from second 5 choices to multiple choice question to proceed.
What are the possible validations I can achieve with this feature
If you are a average to good JavaScript programmer you can solve any validation problem with this feature. A novice to JS could learn the basics and should be able to use the feature to solve straight forward validation problems in the survey.
